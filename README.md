# A complete JSP based application.

Our idea is to design an web application for commuters, travelers, merchants & common people who are used to travel whether it is by railway or by bus or by the highway. This web app helps them to choose the fastest, shortest & best root for their journey. Our app also suggests the best way for their journey. In this app people make their accounts & through this account, they find the best way & best root both. In this app you can also create the event according to your comfort. If someone also goes with you then they can contact you & join you on your journey if you accept their request. There are many other advantages of this app like you can also check bus/train schedules, book your tickets with some cashback offers & discounts. By using our app, we guaranteed you that you reach your destination in the best way at the best time.
